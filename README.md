# NYC Taxi Duration Prediction - Enterprise MLOps Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting NYC taxi trip durations. The system demonstrates enterprise-level machine learning engineering practices with automated monitoring, drift detection, and intelligent alerting capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Data Pipeline
The system processes NYC taxi trip data through a versioned data pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) integrated with Google Cloud Storage. Raw datasets are automatically preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed into features suitable for machine learning models.

### Machine Learning Pipeline
Model training and experimentation is managed through MLflow, providing complete experiment tracking, model versioning, and a centralized model registry. The system supports multiple model versions and automated promotion of best-performing models to production status.

### Deployment Infrastructure
The trained models are containerized using Docker and deployed as a REST API service on Google Cloud Run, providing serverless scaling and high availability. The API service exposes prediction endpoints with comprehensive health monitoring.

### Monitoring and Alerting System
Advanced monitoring stack includes statistical drift detection, data quality assessment, and model performance tracking. The system uses Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and AlertManager for intelligent alerting via Slack integration.

3. Data quality metrics assess missing values, outliers, and data volume
4. Model performance tracking monitors prediction accuracy and response times
5. Grafana dashboards provide real-time visualization of all metrics
6. AlertManager triggers notifications when thresholds are exceeded

## Monitoring Capabilities

### Drift Detection
The system implements advanced statistical methods including Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and Wasserstein distance calculations to detect feature drift. When significant changes in data distribution are detected, automated alerts recommend model retraining.

### Data Quality Monitoring
Continuous assessment of data quality includes missing value detection, outlier identification, duplicate record detection, and data volume validation. Quality scores are calculated and tracked over time.

### Model Performance Tracking
Real-time monitoring of model accuracy, prediction latency, API response times, and system resource utilization. Performance degradation triggers automated alerts and retraining recommendations.
